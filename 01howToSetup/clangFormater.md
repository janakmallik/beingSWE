install clang
you can install clang latest with command; pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-clang
search google for latest command
then set the environment path variables to the installed path
for me it was C:\msys64\mingw64\bin

then install clang extension
then open a file name .clang-format
paste google formatter code
done..
