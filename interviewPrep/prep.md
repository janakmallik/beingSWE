4. **Cultural Fit**
   - Alignment with company values and culture, motivation for joining the company

### Additional Topics
1. **Object-Oriented Design**
   - Principles like SOLID, design patterns (singleton, factory, observer)

2. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Writing test cases, debugging techniques, dealing with legacy code

3. **Bit Manipulation**
   - Operations like bitwise AND, OR, XOR, shifting

### Preparation Tips
- **Practice Problems:** Regularly solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal.
- **Mock Interviews:** Participate in mock interviews to simulate real interview conditions.
- **Study System Design:** Read books like "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" and "System Design Interview."
- **Review Basics:** Ensure a strong understanding of core computer science concepts.

Focusing on these topics will help you prepare comprehensively for tech interviews at top companies.
