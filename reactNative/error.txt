warn Attempting to debug JS in Flipper (deprecated). This requires Flipper to be installed on your system to handle the 'flipper://' URL scheme.
info In React Native 0.74, Flipper is no longer included for new React Native projects. The Flipper React Native plugin is also unsupported. You can continue to use Flipper to debug your app's JavaScript code, however we recommend switching to a modern alternative.
See https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#opening-the-debugger.
